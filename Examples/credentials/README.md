# Sample credentials

This directory contains sample application credentials for various services.

To use a service, sign up with the service provider, register an app, and
put your app's consumer key and consumer secret (OAuth1) or client id and
client secret (OAuth2) in the corresponding YAML file. 

Then put this YAML file in a directory named `.credentials` in your home
directory.
